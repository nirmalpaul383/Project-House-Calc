          House Calc app is best suitable for stock android with 1280x720 resolution(720p)'s display.
          Although you can change it and rebuild it for best compatibality on other device via source files.
          This is an open source project(originally made by me N Paul) and anybody can view,modify or rebuild it.

About source project:
          This application is made by Tasker (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
          and by Tasker app factory (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory ).
          To install and run 'House Calc' you will 'not need' any of this application.
          However if you want to 'view or modify' source file you 'will need' Tasker application and if you want
          to 'export your own modification' then you 'will need both' Tasker and its extension app Tasker app factory.
